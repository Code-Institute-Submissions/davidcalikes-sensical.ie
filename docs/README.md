When it comes to creating multi-sensory environments, a custom built, dedicated multi sensory space is always the optimal solution. 

Where this is not possible, Sensical Multi-Sensory Solutions can provide a pop-up style multi-sensory experience at an affordable price.

Established in 2019, the business, which operates as a business-to-client sole-tradership, was, like most small enterprises, severely impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Adopting the principles of [concentric diversification](https://www.monash.edu/business/marketing/marketing-dictionary/c/concentric-diversification#:~:text=a%20growth%20strategy%20in%20which,customers%3B%20also%20called%20convergent%20diversification.), the business owner decided to expand the scope of the Sensical enterprise to include an online store offering a range of affordable multi-sensory products that would appeal to it's established customer base as well as its general target audience.

Growing the business in this way will provide Sensical Multi-Sensory Solutions with a crucial, additional revenue stream that will help the business stay profitable should any losses occur on the "Mobile Sensory Environments Hire" side of the business. 

Such loss can occur when:

* There are 'lock-down' situations in private residential/ residential care settings such as localised outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics.

* The Mobile Sensory Environment Hire service is fully booked.

* The Mobile Sensory Hire Equipment is under repair.

In an attempt to protect the business against the prospect of future 'lock-downs' by providing an additional revenue stream, the business owner decided to expand the scope of Sensical Multi-Sensory Solutions buy offering 

Sensical.ie is the online promotional and business hub for Sensical Mult-Sensory Solutions, allowing users to make bookings for the service via a linked Facebook business page.
