# Sensical.ie

## Overview

Sensical.ie is a full stack, e-Commerce, web application offering affordable, multi-sensory products & solutions to a growing and diverse target audience.

<img src="../docs/readme_images/mockup.png">

<br>

When it comes to creating multi-sensory environments, a custom built, dedicated multi sensory space is always the optimal solution. 

Where this is not possible, Sensical Multi-Sensory Solutions can provide a pop-up style multi-sensory experience at an affordable price.

Originally called Sensical 'Mobile Sensory Environments', the business was established in 2018, operating as a business-to-client sole-tradership. Like most small enterprises the project was severely impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic.

In an attempt to protect the venture from future existential threats, the business owner developed a new growth-through-diversification strategy for the enterprise.

The Sensical.ie, e-Commerce Webstore offers, affordable, high quality, sensory products that enhance the sensory experience of sensory therapy service users, either alongside or abstract from the 'Mobile Sensory Environments' (Equipment Hire) branch of the business.

Utilising the Django Full Stack Web Framework, Bootstrap and Stripe API for secure payments, the Sensical.ie Webstore offers it's customers an effortless, logical and rewarding user experience.

<br>

## Background Information

I established Sensical 'Mobile-Sensory Environments' in 2018 and operated the business as a sole tradership. Throughout the rest of this project's documentation including the README, AGILE and TESTING.md files, I will refer to "The Business Owner" or "Site Owner" in an attempt to make the distinction between myself as a software developer and as the owner-operator of the Sensical enterprise.

'Sensical MSE' was borne out of the real world need for low-cost multi-sensory rooms/experiences in the ever-changing landscape of disability care-provision in Ireland.

<br>

# Planning & Research

## Prior Business Model



<br>

### Primary Target Audience:

<br>

Having witnessed first hand the scale and impact of sweeping [deinstitutionalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation) reforms within Irish state-run healthcare facilities, the business owner noticed an opportunity to provide patients and service users with affordable, sensory experiences.

Whilst agreeing that the rights and dignity of residential service users should always be paramount, there are [many issues](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1468017318793620) that arise when deinstitutionalisation occurs.

<img src="../docs/readme_images/business1.png">

There are two key negative consequences that affect the provision of Multi-Sensory Services as a result of this process.

* The decentralisation of resources leading to limited access/availability.

* Lack of funding for therapeutic activites due to increased cost of living

As mentioned above, there is no substitute for a purpose-built, well-maintained, fully stocked Multi-Sensory Room. Many residential care centers(institutions) would offer residents scheduled access to such a facility on a regular basis. Situated on campus grounds, the MSR would be wheelchair accessable and just a short distance from a place of residence. Moving service users into community housing severly removes or inhibits this access due to remote housing locations and trasportation issues.

There are also issues with finding the funds, physical space, and expertise to build and maintain a high-quality, sensory room within community housing.

This is where Sensical Mobile-Sensory Environments comes in. For a nominal fee, the pop-up sensory service can transform almost any room into a viable sensory space. 

This is achieved by the following. 

* Bringing the Sensory Equipment to the service user at their point of need.

* Setting up the space by safely blacking-out natural light and implimenting a custom-built, industry standard, sensory lighting system.

* Applying relaxing sensory sounds and fragrances to suit the clients needs.

* Supplying supplementary tactile items to enhance the service users enjoyment.


Benefits of the service include:


* Continuity of service. Users can enjoy the familiarity of having a recognisible service even if they move house or use the service in different areas like day care or school.

* No maintainence costs or storage issues. Sensical maintains its own equipment to the highest standard and removes it when you are finished.

* No travel or dedicated space required. Sensical systems are set up within minutes.

* No huge outlay or lengthy contract. Just pay as you go.


### Secondary Target Audience

The original business was also aimed at customers who needed sensory services in their own private residences. The service proved popular with parents and children with autistic spectrum disorder and learning disabilites. Another way customers utilised the service was block-booking sensory equipment for private residential birthday parties, where one or more of the attendees could avail of a relaxing space should they become overstimulated. 

<br>

<img src="../docs/readme_images/business2.png">_Prior business model._
 <br>

## Drawbacks

There are of course drawbacks to any business plan and Sensical is no different.

Firstly, the business model is, in essence, part of what many dub 'the gig economy'. This means that the business will not produce revenue unless it is consistently finding new customers and providing the service on a regular basis.

Initially, this was not an immediate problem, as the business owner was higly motivated, technically minded and had a huge wealth of knowledge and transferable skills from many years working as a successful touring musician.

Unfortunately, like every other small enterprise, Sensical MSE was badly affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. Due to restrictions on movement, entering residences, social distancing guidlines, and the closure of schools and day centers, the project ground to a halt in 2020.

As with many other startup owners during Covid, the year 2020 proved to be a time of reflection and creative restructuring for the owner operator of Sensical Mobile Sensory Environments.

I have outlined in the sections below the owner's new vision for the re-imagined company, and the role they hope this e-commerce website will have in making the new business comercially successful.

<br>

## New Business Model

<br>

<img src="../docs/readme_images/business3.png">_New business model._

<br>

<details>

<summary>
Updated Business Strategy</summary><br>

Adopting the principles of [concentric diversification](https://www.monash.edu/business/marketing/marketing-dictionary/c/concentric-diversification#:~:text=a%20growth%20strategy%20in%20which,customers%3B%20also%20called%20convergent%20diversification.), the business owner decided to expand the scope of the Sensical enterprise to include an online Webstore offering a range of affordable multi-sensory products that would appeal to it's established customer base as well as a more general target audience.

Growing the business in this way will provide the newly rebranded 'Sensical Multi-Sensory Solutions' with a crucial, additional revenue stream that will help the business stay profitable should any losses occur on the "Mobile Sensory Environments Hire" side of the business. 

Such loss can occur when:

* There are 'lock-down' situations in private residential/residential care settings such as localised outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics.

* The Mobile Sensory Environment Hire service is fully booked.

* The Mobile Sensory Hire Equipment is under repair.

The purpose of selling good quality, carefully selected, supplementary, products is to provide hygenic, affordable enhancements to a customers multi-sensory experience, without the risk of making our 'Mobile Sensory Environments' equipment hire service redundant.

</details>
<br>

<details>

<summary>
e-Commerce Strategy</summary><br>

As referenced above, the business owner does not want the 'Equipment Hire' side of the business to suffer as a result of sales from the e-Commerce store. 

In order to mitigate against this, the Sensical.ie Webstore will only stock supplimentary products that can enhance a customers enjoyment during a sensory session, but can in no way recreate the unique sensory experience of a custom Mobile Sensory Environment, when used in isolation.

As [this article](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/parents-are-not-ok-after-3-years-of-covid-and-a-brutal-winter-of-children-s-respiratory-illness-1.6231476) from January 2023 demonstrates, many parents and care providers are still wary of COVID (and other respiratory ilnesses) community spread.

The Sensical.ie Webstore will allow customers to purchase their own sensory items, musical instruments, accessories and more, ensuring peace of mind that all items are sanitary. This also significantly reduces the hire services maintainence and cleaning budget.

The site should make it as simple as possible for the user to identify products they wish to purchase, identify their availability, suitablity, and aspect and also seemlessly complete payment of products they have added to their shopping basket via a checkout feature.

The Webstore should encourage users to create and account in order to make return visits even easier, by storing delivery information and a wishlist of possible future purchases to their user profile.

The Webstore should be easy to navigate and offer the user the ability to see products from specific categories, subcategories and availability.

The Website (outwith the Webstore) should also include information about the Equipment Hire side of the business, and provide links to the already established Facebook Business Page to encourage purchasing customers to also make a booking. This would increas the sites rating on popular search engines like Google and Bing by underlining the legitimacy of the site, its content and subject matter. See below for how the business owner hopes the Webstore will synergise with the hire business and help maximise profitability.

</details>
<br>

<details>

<summary>
Synergetic Approach</summary><br>

Whilst diversification for it's own sake may prove enough of a reason for the introduction of the e-Commerce Webstore, there are other benefits that may also be advantageous. To demonstrate how this might work I have created the following persona:
 
Persona Name: 
* Emma Kearns.

Age:
* 14

Job/Role: 
* School Pupil

Status:
* Minor.

Other Information:
* Highly Functioning Autistic School Pupil.
* Loves water, marine life and the sea side.
* Struggles with concentration due to anxiety.
* Both parents are separated.
* Lives with Mum and stays sometimes with Dad.

Goals:
* To eleviate anxiety/stress
* To relax enough to think and perform tasks
* To enjoy my spare time.

Pain Point/Concerns:
* I love my Mum, She understands me more than anyone but she never has time to take me to the beach or swimming anymore.
* I love my Dad but I feel like there's no relaxing space for me when Mum is on nights and I stay over at his house.
* I wish I could take my water basin with me when I visit the sensory room at the solas centre but I'm not allowed.
* I love listening to the sea in sea shells I find at the beach but mum says they're too dirty to bring home.

Likes/Dislikes

* I love water, the sea and the ocean. It helps me relax just thinking about it.

* I dislike loud noises and have a phobia of spiders.


Sensical Multi-Sensory Solutions could, hypothetically, provide Emma with a relaxing, yet stimulating underwater-themed sensory experience whether she stays with her Mum or Dad. When liasing with hiring customers, the business owner will conduct a thorough interview and determine which elements of their technical inventory would be best suited to create the perfect sensory environment.

It is at this stage however, that this particular customer and her parents could be directed towards the Sensical.ie Webstore. Emma likes to listen to the sound of the ocean but Mum is worried about hygeine? Well the Webstore currently have an 'Ocean Drum' in stock. An 'Ocean Drum' is a traditional percussion instrument that replicates the sound of the ocean in the palm of your hand... and it has a wipe-clean hygenic surface.

Should the Kearns family purchase such an item, plus say perhaps a bubble-tube lighting fixture and a heavy duty blackout blind, then not only will the Webstore generate revenue in the short term, but the Hire service will no longer have to load those items the next visit during setup, saving the customer time and providing better value for money. (Less time filling and emptying bubble tubes means more time enjoying the Sensory Environment)

When developing real-world business relationships like this, it will inform the business owners descisions when purchasing future products to sell in the Webstore. A business plan with its own in-built market research strategy.
</details>
<br>

## Project Problem Statement

I developed the following problem statement to refer to during development.

"To help facilitate the provision of sensory services and products via the most synergetic approach possible, for the mutual benefit of both the customer and business".

I'm aware that problem statements like this shouldn't really incorporate the wellbeing of the business, but I have decided to include it here due to the simple fact that it is the only business of it's kind in Ireland and the experiences and benefits it can offer to its service users and customers depends entirely on its commercial success.

<br>

## User Experience Design

### Target Audience

Sensical.ie is aimed at providing existing service-users of Sensical Multi-Sensory Solutions and new customers with the ability to purchase supplimentary sensory items to enhance the customers enjoyment of any sensory environment. The website is specifically aimed at users who have recently moved from residential care homes to comunity houses where there is a deficit of therapy provision due to the lack of centralised resources.
<br>

### Target Audience summary

* Users who with disabilities who live in community housing and have no access to 
holistic therapies. 

* Users who are relatives of people with disabilities who live in community housing and have no access to holistic therapies.

* Users who are parents of children with autistic spectrum disorder or intellectiual disabilities.

* Private residential users who wish to use Sensical Multi-Sensory Solutions equpiment hire services for a special event or party.

* Users who are existing customers of Sensical Multi-Sensory Solutions equipment hire service.

* Users who wish to purchase products annonymously.

## Objectives of Sensical.ie

<br>

* To make Sensical.ie a viable solution to an existing problem.

* To make the purpose of the app obvious to the user.

* To provide users with an enjoyable, intuitive and easy to use interface.

* To provide users with a positive user experience, underwritten by feelings of familiarity, confidence and security.

* To provide a positive user experience whilst protecting user data.

<br>

## Planning Summary & Approach

<br>

* A Secure, Full Stack, e-Commerce web application will be created.

* The Webstore will be intuitively designed and use standard e-Commerce business practices to promote uninhibited purchases and multiple return visits. (Three-click rule, wishlist, user profiles etc.)

* The Webstore will only sell products that are supplementary to the 'Multi Sensory Environments'(equipment hire) business within the umbrella of Sensical Multi-Sensory Services.

* The Site will also include links, information and media about the 'equipment hire' business.

* Any products and information featured will be displayed to the user logically and informed by planning and research.

* The app will be created following the principles of user experience design.

* The app will be simple to use and provide visual feedback for all users.

* The app will contain links to relevant external websites and contain metadata keywords to improve Search Engine Optimisation.

<br>

## Database Schema

<img src="../docs/readme_images/business4.png"> _Sensical.ie Database Schema._

The above image shows the Data Schema for the Sensical.ie project and the relationships between the models.

The e-Commerce store has 4 main models, 2 product related and 2 purchase related.

A unique feature of the product model is the for_sensory_needs data point, where the site owner can add prescriptive phrases that will result in the displaying of informative text icons in the DOM. (Rainbow for Autism ect)

The Product Wishlist Data is also stored in this model. I stored this data point here as it seemed the simplest and less verbose way of coding the wishlist functionality. 

The Client Testimonial, Packages are for administrative users(site owners) only and facilitate the creation and maintainance of Testimonials and Packages within the site. 

The Package Request model allows users to submit a request for a custom sensory hire package through a simple contact form.

<br>

## Data Flow 

<img src="../docs/readme_images/business5.png"> _Sensical.ie Data Flow._


The above example is a simplistic overview of how the website works. The ability for visiting/unregistered users to make purchases is important so the flow is unrestricted in that respect. The storage of delivery information and purchase history to a registered users profile however should encourage future visits and make the checkout process even simpler. The wishlist functionality will also encourage future transactions, affording users the chance to save desired out of stock items for a later date. The site owners will benefit from the ability to promote the Equipment Hire side of the business by adding and editing heartfelt testimonials and tempting package deals.

<br>

# Agile

Sensical.ie was developed using the Agile Development Methodology. A detailed overview of the Agile process is availiable [here.](https://github.com/davidcalikes/sensical.ie/blob/main/docs/AGILE.md)

<br>

# Testing

The app was conscientiously tested during and post development.
The testing results for MyPSE.ie are available [here.](https://github.com/davidcalikes/sensical.ie/blob/main/docs/TESTING.md)


# Visual Design

## Wireframes

I designed wireframes for reference as I began to develop the application. They are instructive as to how I wanted the app to display across multiple device widths. I deviated slightly from the original designs as the overall style became more refined. For example, to give the site a more dynamic look on some of the information pages I staggered the order of the elements using Bootstraps order classes.


<img src="../docs/readme_images/visual_design1.png"><br>
_Staggered Elements_

Here are the wireframes:

<img src="../docs/readme_images/wireframes_wishlist.png"><br>
_Wishlist Wireframe_

<img src="../docs/readme_images/wireframes_hire.png"><br>
_Hire Wireframe_

Due to the scope of this application and how similar many of the pages are, I thought it unnecessary to include every single page here. Like the auth pages for example.


## Color Scheme

<img src="../docs/readme_images/visual_colors.png"><br>
_Sensical.ie Color Scheme_
 

The color scheme of the site was derived from marketing material submitted by the business owner. The Mobile Sensory Environments side of the business still had an excess of flyers, posters and leaflets remaining so it seemed prudent to continue with the original color scheme used throughout most of the business's promotional media.


<img src="../docs/readme_images/visual_design2.png"><br>
_Sensical.ie Color Scheme_

<br>


After some consideration for users who may have light sensitivity issues, I used a dark blue background almost as a default "dark mode" for most of the site. The general tone of the color scheme is almost medical, and this is reflected in the pastel green and pink shades used to indicate stock status by framing the borders of product cards. I feel the color scheme works well. It reflects the purpose of the business and looks professional enough without taking itself too seriously.

<br>

## Typography

*  There are two fonts used throughout the application.

    * Assistant: A strong, elegant font for heading elements adopted from the business's promotional media.
   
    * Helvetica: A clear, familiar and accessible font is used in paragraph text.

    The fonts were imported to the project head element.

<br>

<img src="../docs/readme_images/feat_nav_collapsed.png"><br>
_Sensical.ie Collapsible Menu_

<br>

## The Delivery Banner

Although the delivery banner is not technically available across every page of the site, I've included it here as it felt like it belonged to the nav section of the project. 

The Delivery Banner provides dynamic visual feedback to purchasing customers regarding a free delivery offer when users spend more than €50.

<img src="../docs/readme_images/feat_delivery_banner1.png"><br>
_Delivery Banner_

If a user adds a product to their basket the Delivery Banner Updates.

When the delivery threshold has been met by the user the banner changes to the following.

<img src="../docs/readme_images/feat_delivery_banner3.png"><br>

I included the Delivery Banner only on pages related to the e-Commerce side of the site a I felt it could free up a useable section of screen real estate for the information pages.

<br>

## The Footer

<img src="../docs/readme_images/feat_footer.png"><br>
_Sensical.ie Footer_

The fully responsive footer is present across all pages of the site and contains two main sections.

Home Page</summary><br>

* The Home page contains a high quality hero video with a clever H1 heading that is relevant to the business and informative to the user. The heading text has a shadow quality that allows it to maintain readability despite the dynamic background. I thought about using a nice blur filter here to make the text really ledgible, however the business owner wanted the background to be clearly recognisable as a classroom, so potential customers would recognise the transformative power of the sensory equipment hire business. The hero video is strategically places to allow some content to show from the base of the page, encouraging users to scroll further. 

<img src="../docs/readme_images/feat_home_hero.png"><br>
_Sensical.ie Hero Video & CTA Buttons_

* The call to action buttons provide the user with instant access to the two main data streams of the site. The first button, SHOP leads to the e-Commerce side of the application where the second button leads to the Hiring/Information side.

<img src="../docs/readme_images/feat_cta_buttons.png"><br>
_Sensical.ie Hero Video & CTA Buttons_

* There are three 'Home Cards' That provide the user with information regarding the purpose and functionality of both the site and the business. The home cards are elegantly designed and contain images and links to the three main site areas.

* This row of icons contains visual feedback to the user regarding the suitability of each item. The key for the feature is as follows: 

* The RAINBOW icon denotes this item may help people living with autistic spectrum disorder.
* The HANDS icon denotes this item may help people living with Tactile sensory needs.
* The EYE icon denotes this item may help people living with ADHD.
* The HEADPHONES icon denotes this item may help people Auditory Sensory Needs.
* The MOON icon denotes this item may help people living with Anxiety.
* The LIGHTBULB icon denotes this item may not be suitable for people with photo sensitive epilepsy.

The Site Administrator can attach each Icon to a product using the following keywords in the For Sensory Needs Form Field.

* ADHD for ADHD
* ASD for ASD
* TOUCH for Tactile sensory issues.
* AUDIO for Auditory sensory issues
* RELAX for anxiety issues.
* LIGHT for Photosensitivity issues.

* The next noteworthy feature is the product quantity selector. This will allow users to add up to 10 of any given items at a time to the their shopping basket.

_Sensical.ie Quantity Selector_

* As the business is carries an extremely small inventory at afforable prices, it was important to the business owners to limit bulk purchases in this way, in order to properly grow their busness, the company wished to reach as many different customers as possible rather than wholesale to just a few bulk buyers. This feature will be atapted in future iterations of the site, where the selector will feature only the amount of products available in stock at any given time providing feedback for the user and managing stock level issues at the point of sale.

At the base of the page the consistently styled Product Detail Buttons allow users to continue shopping or add the current product to their basket or wishlist.

_Sensical.ie Wishlist Success_

* Whenever a registered user adds a product to their wishlist, they are informed by a success message. If the wishlist contains many items the wishlist messages container allow the user to scroll through the items on the message container itself. Users can also directly access the wishlist from the message container. A users wishlist, and the items within it are saved for the users convenience even if they log out or refresh their browser.

<img src="../docs/readme_images/wishlist_items.png"><br>
_Sensical.ie Wishlist Items_

The Wishlist Page itself is elegant in its simplicity and maintains many of the design features consistent with the rest of the site. Including the pleasing contrast between the vibrant foreground images and the background and the familiar looking 'Find More Products' 'Add to Basket' and 'Remove Form Wishlist buttons. The Move to Basket feature is designed to maximise convenience for user. Adding a product to the basket from the wishlist does not remove it from the wishlist. This is entirely intentional, as the business owners insist that many users will be clients or the carers or parents of clients that will often have to re-order products because of damage or wear from overuse, so having all your favorite products in the one place will be of maximum benefit to users in these situations.

_Sensical.ie Shopping Basket Items_

* The basket items section contains horizontal product cards each displaying a thumbnail image, name, price and quantity of each basket item. Every card has its own sort selector and update button allowing users to modify their basket without having to return to the products page. There is also a feature that allows the user to remove the entire quantity of an item from the basket if they desire. I think this page justifies the intentional design choice to have a darker background, as the colorful products really pop out in contrast to the neutral backdrop.

<img src="../docs/readme_images/basket_summary.png"><br>
_Sensical.ie Shopping Basket Summary_

* The shopping basket summary section contains an efficient overview of the cost of the users basket items. The summary section allows users to return to the products page or continue to the checkout to complete their purchases.

* The Checkout Page has a heading summary that carries the total cost information over from the basket page.

<img src="../docs/readme_images/checkout_items.png"><br>
_Sensical.ie Checkout Page Items_

* The Checkout page also has a similar items list to the basket page, but with truncated features. This was purposely designed to not only differentiate the Checkout Page from the Shopping Basket Page but to also discourage users from changing their minds and removing items from their basket at the last minute.

_Sensical.ie Checkout Delivery Accordian_

The Checkout Delivery Accordian contains a users delivery information in a handy dropdown accordian. 

The delivery information is prepopulated in the form if a user has it saved to their profile. There is also the option for registered users to save their information to their profile if they have not already done so.

<img src="../docs/readme_images/checkout_payment_details.png"><br>
_Sensical.ie Checkout Payment Details Section_

At the base of the checkout page, there is a form input for a user to enter their credit/debit card. The area contains a field for the users card number, a submit order button for users to complete the order and a back to basket button for users to return to the shopping basket without submitting the order. There us some warning text that provides feedback for the user regarding how much their card will be charged. I have included some out size fontawsome card icons here. I think the globally recognised financial institutions would inspire customer confidence in the site and promote multiple visits and purchases. 

Also included in this section is a link to the terms and conditions of the sites use to protect the business against contingent liabilities.

<img src="../docs/readme_images/checkout_loading.png"><br>
_Sensical.ie Checkout Loading Modal_

When a payment is submitted a spinning logo and feedback message fills the page as the request is being processed by the Stripe API. The modal is important as it prevents the user from interacting with the site diring the paymemt process whilst keeping them informed that the payment is being processed.

<img src="../docs/readme_images/checkout_success.png"><br>
_Sensical.ie Checkout Success Page_

If an order is successfully completed, the user is notified, and returned to the checkout success page. This page provides the user details of their purchase and is backed u to their user profile if they have one. There is a link to return to the users profile page if they are registered users and a link back to the home page if they are not.
